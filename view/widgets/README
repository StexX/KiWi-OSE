There are two kinds of widgets in KiWi at the moment:
- jQuery widgets: these are plugins for jQuery that can be attached to a block element in the HTML code; an example
  of how this works is given in the recommendations/ folder (Javascript widget and HTML test file)
- XHTML widgets: these are fragments that are included using ui:include; they have been moved to the ../panels folder
