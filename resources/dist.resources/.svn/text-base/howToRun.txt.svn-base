Java Settings
=============

KiWi requires Java 6.0 (1.6).

Because KiWi must run on a lot of different platforms and because the Java
install location can vary very wildly, you must take care of this detail
(right Java installation) yourself.

After Java is installed, you must make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment
variable is set correctly.

For Mac OS:
In a terminal, run the following commands:

echo $JAVA_HOME

If the result is a path to the right Java version, then you don't need the
next steps.

JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.XXX/Home
export JAVA_HOME

Replace the XXX with your right java version

For Linux :
The same steeps as on Mac OS.  The only difference is the Java install
location (/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-XXXX on many Linux systems).



Start KiWi
==========

To start KiWi, follow these steps:

1. Go into the bin directory and run the start.xxx script, xxx is depending
   you your operation system (for Mac OS and linux xxx=sh, and for Windows
   xxx=bat).  2. Wait until the terminal window where start.xxx runs shows an
   output similar to:
[org.jboss.system.server.Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.2.3.GA (build: SVNTag=JBoss_4_2_3_GA date=200807181439)] Started in ........
3. Open the web browser and use the URL : http://localhost:8080/KiWi/home.seam

Alternative to point 3: After the server was started, you can do a double
click on the KiWi symbol placed in the notification area.
