This directory contains a sum of sun space related resources
 (e.g. configuration files, profiles etc) .
 
 jboss-log4j.xml - is related with the sun space import feature, the import
generates a lot of output that's why is preferable to limit this output.
The usage is simple just copy it in ....yourJBoss/server/default/log and restart
the server. If you care about your previous log configuration save it before you
replace it with this one.
