			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who is &#8220;Hudson&#8221; you may ask. Well, Hudson is a guy who accompanied us throughout this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.schaffert.eu/2009/03/16/1st-kiwi-programming-camp/trackback/">1st KiWi Programming Camp</a>. Hudson is the one who complains when something goes wrong in the source code, for example when one of the tests breaks or worse: the source code does not compile properly. And Hudson had to complain a lot during this week!</p>
<p>So why is this a success then? Well, many complaints means that there has been a lot of activity in the source code, and this means that many people started committing their additions and changes. And this was actually the stated main goal of the 1st KiWi Programming Camp: help the KiWis and friends learn how to work with the code so that they can do their own modifications, particularly for implementing the enabling technologies and the use cases.</p>
<p>But the KiWi Programming Camp was also very successful in its second objective: starting to build up an Open Source community around KiWi. Although we sent out the invitation on very short notice (4 days before the camp started), we were joined by two additional external developers during the week who wanted to learn how to extend the system for their own purposes: Christoph Lange from Jacobs University of Bremen builds a Semantic Wiki for mathematical knowledge called &#8220;<a href="http://kwarc.info/projects/swim/">SWiM</a>&#8221; and Michael Schneider from <a href="http://artaround.at/">ArtAround</a>, a small company in Salzburg, wants to build a community platform for art on top of KiWi.</p>
<p>Besides this, the programming camp was also a great place for spinning new ideas and moving the project forward. Since I did not want to disturb the social dynamics between the young researchers through my presence, I only joined from time to time, and every time I entered the room there have been lively discussions, people arguing at the flip chart, people programming together. In fact, I think we did not have many weeks in the project where we did such big conceptual steps forward like this week.</p>
<p>Among other issues, we managed to move forward the issue of annotating text fragments, the issue of semantic forms which are linked to the textual content, the recommendation functionalities, as well as compound content items. We also had quite some interesting discussions on search and querying, on reasoning, and on information extraction.</p>
<p>So, thanks for all who attended (i.e. Fred, Karsten, Marek, Klara, Jakub, Alex, Christoph, Michael) and particularly to my team in Salzburg (Rolf, Steffi, Szaby, Mihai, Thomas) for preparing it and helping the others get into the system. I am really looking forward to the 2nd KiWi Programming Camp, which will probably take place in autumn and be open to everyone interested to participate!</p>
<p>Now, we should probably try to get to &#8220;Hudson build is stable again&#8221;, so that we can prepare for the next prerelease end of March. <img src='http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, immediately following the Annual Meeting, we have the first KiWi Programming Camp, where interested programmers around Europe meet and get to know the KiWi core system and - of course - each other. Originally, we planned to have the first programming camp only for project members (i.e. those colleagues from within the project who are supposed to implement in the system in the next stage of the project), but last week, we decided that there is no real reason why it could not be opened up to interested developers outside KiWi as well and begin building up an Open Source community around KiWi. And so, we sent out a short notice invitation, and we now have three additional developers from outside the project joining the programming camp plus some interested colleagues here in Salzburg. I would bet that if we had sent out the invitation earlier, we would not have had the same kind of success. <img src='http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The goals of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>get developers accustomed with the component-based architecture of the KiWi system and with the build environment</li>
<li>get developers to know each other better so that they can more easily communicate when they are back home</li>
<li>start the work on additional components that are not developed here in Salzburg but by our partners; starting work is the hardest step - once you have started, it is much easier to continue &#8230;</li>
<li>set the foundations for the KiWi Open Source Community</li>
</ul>
<p>If the programming camp turns out to be successful, we will likely have additional programming camps on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months. In addition to the programming camps, our Open Source strategy also foresees a KiWi Challenge, and KiWi practical courses at universities.</p>
<p>So, look forward to the next release end of March, because we will very likely have begun work on a number of new topics.;-)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The KiWi Annual Meeting 2009 took place last week from 11th to 13th of March in beautiful <a href="http://www.schloss-leopoldskron.com/">Schloss Leopoldskron</a> close to downtown Salzburg. Schloss Leopoldskron is a seminar site owned by Salzburg Global Seminars and thus offers all the facilities for hosting such a meeting. After one year of KiWi, we already had quite a lot to present:</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> <strong>morning</strong> started with me presenting a look back (see also <a href="http://www.schaffert.eu/2009/02/27/happy-birthday-kiwi/trackback/">this blogpost</a>) and a look forward into the next year of KiWi. Just to briefly summarise what we are up to in the coming months: a KiWi 1.0 release with the core system finished, then start of the implementation of reasoning &amp; querying, reason maintenance, information extraction, and personalisation, as well as the two use case applications. As part of the implementation of the use case at Sun, we are also going to integrate Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/community-equity">Community Equity</a> into the system. In parallel, as part of our dissemination strategy, we now start building up a Open Source Community around KiWi (see also the post about the first KiWi programming camp), because we believe that KiWi as a platform can be useful for many Open Source developers who want to build social software platforms.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="kiwi_annual_welcome" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kiwi_annual_welcome.jpg" alt="kiwi_annual_welcome" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>After this introduction, I gave a demonstration of the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi">current KiWi system</a> as we <a href="http://www.schaffert.eu/2009/02/27/first-kiwi-open-source-release/trackback/">released it</a> two weeks ago. If you want to try this out without downloading, simply visit the <a href="http://showcase.kiwi-project.eu/KiWi/">Showcase</a>. Szaby then followed with a presentation of the rationale behind the<a href="http://www.schaffert.eu/2009/02/12/the-kiwis-new-clothes-kiwi-linked-data/trackback/"> KiWi user interface</a>, summarising a meeting we had beginning of February. We had quite some discussions on some of the aspects, particularly the &#8220;stream of activities&#8221;, which we consider a major part of any social software system. Rolf introduced into the<em> KiWi architecture and extension mechanism</em>, and Steffi concluded the morning session with a presentation of the <em>transaction and revision system</em> she is currently working on, one of the core components of the KiWi system.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday afternoon</strong> was dedicated to the <em>enabling technologies</em>. Jakub started with presenting his ideas for a <em>rule-based reasoning language </em>based on tags, and he showed us some of the challenges arising in social media (e.g. concerning negation). Jakub was also concerned with how reason maintenance can help to explain to the user why certain things happen (like the system being inconsistent). Klara followed with a presentation of the <em>label-keyword search</em> functionality she envisions. Label-keyword search will allow to query content not only based on text but also on structure and meta-data. Pavel and Marek then showed how<em> information extraction</em> using an extension of latent semantic analysis could help to automatically annotate content and suggest tags. And Peter D. and Fred discussed various algorithms and their exemplary implementation that can be used for recommending related content items to the user based on tags and context as part of their work on <em>personalisation</em>. Eventually, you will find this and more in the planned Dashboard application. We concluded the day with a dinner in a nearby restaurant where we could introduce our guests into the Austrian kitchen (Griesnockerlsuppe, &#8230;).</p>
<p><strong>Thursday morning</strong> started with Julia presenting the<em> KiWi Dissemination Plan</em> and strategy for the next year. This inspired quite some discussion on target groups and relevant conferences so that the session took 90 minutes instead of the planned 45 and I had to move my presentation of the Open Source strategy (which is part of Dissemination) to Friday. The second part of the morning was on financial issues, a boring but important topic for the project.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" title="kiwi_annual_julia" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kiwi_annual_julia.jpg" alt="kiwi_annual_julia" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong>Thursday afternoon </strong>was time for the two <em>use cases</em>: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/peterreiser/">Peter Reiser</a> and Josef described to the broader audience the refocussing of the Sun use case to addressing the whole Sun Intranet (SunSpace) instead of only the Netbeans community. Of major importance will be the integration with Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/peterreiser/category/Community+Equity">Community Equity</a> algorithm for &#8220;measuring&#8221; the social value of one&#8217;s participation - could be a really cool feature even outside the use case. While this all seems like a big change, we realised that it was only a refocussing regarding the content and functionality we had planned from the very beginning.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" title="kiwi_annual_peterreiser" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kiwi_annual_peterreiser.jpg" alt="kiwi_annual_peterreiser" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Daniel, Fred, Peter Dolog, and Peter Axel Nielsen (lots of Peters in the project&#8230;) then described advances in the Logica use case. From that session (and the session on Friday morning) it became a lot more clear to us what is actually needed at Logica: a tool for moving from informal content (project descriptions) to formal content (ERP system and QM system). I think that we might find here many interesting complementary issues to the Sun use case, most importantly the realisation of semantic forms as alternate views to content items and the connection of form fields with human-readable content marked up with annotations.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday evening</strong>, we had our social event with a tour through Salzburg&#8217;s largest brewery (Stiegl), followed by a nice dinner at the brewery&#8217;s restaurant. I think that all participants really enjoyed this dinner after the intensive working day.</p>
<p><strong>Friday morning</strong>, it was again time for me to present: first, I outlined the <em>KiWi release roadmap</em> and how we envision that the development of the KiWi system continues in the next months, particularly with respect to the integration of the enabling technologies. Afterwards, I briefly introduced into the <em>KiWi Open Source strategy</em>: the main message is that you do not build up a community by simply publishing the source code. Rather, it requires a lot of effort on our side. Main measures during the project are the KiWi Programming Camps (the first one is taking place this week), the KiWi Challenge, and the KiWi Practical Courses at universities.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" title="kiwi_annual_os" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kiwi_annual_os.jpg" alt="kiwi_annual_os" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>In the second half of the morning session we had group work where we dicussed in four groups how the final KiWi system should look like, particularly regarding the two use cases and the enabling technologies. I think that most of us now have a much clearer picture of what is expected. Overall, we decided that we should have more such sessions in coming meetings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="kiwi_annual_discussions" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kiwi_annual_discussions.jpg" alt="kiwi_annual_discussions" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Friday afternoon</strong> was dedicated to the <em>General Assembly</em>. The main issues to discuss were the refocussing of the use case at Sun and the planning of the review meeting in June. We concluded at around 4:30 in the afternoon, and are now looking forward to another busy week at the 1st KiWi Programming Camp!</p>
<p>Overall, a very successful meeting where we could really move forward. The best thing, however, about the meeting was definately the organisation and location (thanks, Julia!). In such an inspiring surrounding it was really easy to come together and exchange ideas, and get motivated for the year to come.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, the ontolog series of virtual conferences on the topic of <a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SemanticWiki">Semantic Wikis</a> finished with a summary over the last sessions and an outlook and discussion of the future. Since I was one of the organisers of the first Semantic Wiki workshop in 2006, I was invited to co-chair the series, but also the rest of the KiWi team was represented prominently. Peter Dolog, for example, attended almost all of the sessions and contributed with several presentations.</p>
<p>To me, the ontolog series was interesting for several reasons: (1) it showed that the topic of Semantic Wikis is moving from the outskirts to the mainstream Semantic Web research and is now recognised as important where many people smiled at us 3 years ago; (2) it provided interesting insights and ideas on the Semantic Wiki topic, its applications,  relevant technologies, and the future; and (3), it structured the community even beyond Europe.</p>
<p>Instead of telling you too much, I&#8217;d simply like to refer you to the ontolog series pages; all presentations are available with slides and audio transcript, and the chat sessions have also been logged:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2008_10_23">Session 1</a>: A Survery of the Landscape and State-of-the-Art in Semantic Wikis</li>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2008_11_20">Session 2</a>: Semantic Wiki Technology 1</li>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2008_12_11">Session 3</a>: Semantic Wiki Technology 2</li>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2009_01_22">Session 4</a>: Semantic Wiki Applications &amp; Use Cases (1)</li>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2009_02_12">Session 5</a>: Semantic Wiki Applications &amp; Use Cases (2)</li>
<li><a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ConferenceCall_2009_03_05">Session 6</a>: The Future of Semantic Wiki: Trends, Challenges and Outlook</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Li_Ding">Li Ding</a> has also provided a <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/2009/03/05/musing-the-future-of-semantic-wikis/trackback/">short summary over the last session</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Die letzte Woche waren in Bayern Faschingsferien, und gleichzeitig Schneeferien, so viel hat es bei uns geschneit. Zum Glück ist die letzten 2 Tage wieder viel davon getaut und der Pulver hat sich gesetzt, es reicht auch so noch. Faschingsferien sind bei uns in den Bergen Skiferien, und so hatten meine Töchter Samstag-Dienstag einen Skikurs am Hochschwarzeck in der Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden, mit 20 Minuten sozusagen das uns nächstgelegene Skigebiet. Und Samstag bis Dienstag waren auch gleichzeitig die Tage mit dem meisten Schneefall.</p>
<p>Am Dienstag sind wir vor lauter Schnee (dann etwa 1,50m) nur noch über Umwege und mit Schwierigkeiten (= Schneeketten aufziehenden Holländern und Dänen <img src='http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) aufs Schwarzeck hochgekommen. Während die Kinder ihren Tiefschnee-Skikurs hatten, hatte ich meine Tiefschnee-Skitour und habe tapfer eine Spur durch den Tiefschnee auf das <a href="http://www.schaffert.eu/2009/02/15/sonnenuntergang-am-hirscheck/trackback/">Hirscheck</a> gelegt (während die meisten anderen die Piste entlang hochmarschiert sind). Wenn man selbst mit Ski etwa einen Meter einsinkt, dann dauert die &#8220;Milchkaffee-Tour&#8221; statt 30 Minuten dann 2 Stunden. Und so sieht es dabei aus:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-245" title="hirscheck-001" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hirscheck-001.jpg" alt="hirscheck-001" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Das ist der eigentlich sonst recht komfortable Hohlweg durch den Wald, von hohl ist nicht mehr viel zu sehen und von Weg schon gleich gar nicht. Mittags dann runter und gleich nochmal rauf (was will man machen wenn man auf die Kinder wartet, frieren ist jedenfalls genausowenig das meine wie so wie viele andere an der Lifttalstation Currywurst zu essen). Und oben am Hirscheckkaser dann jeweils ein frisches Radler, da hat sich die Mühe schon gelohnt. Bei der zweiten Runde hatte ich dann sogar noch die Gesellschaft von zwei anderen Gleichgesinnten und hab so einiges über Berchtesgadener Neuigkeiten erfahren (wer der neue Wirt am Beck-Haus wird usw.:-) ).</p>
<p>Meine Mädel haben sich derweil zusammen mit den anderen Kindern auch (Premiere!) die große Piste runtergestürzt. Das sieht bei etwa 10 Flöhen dann so aus:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" title="skikurs-001" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/skikurs-001.jpg" alt="skikurs-001" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Und so, echt ein lustiger Anblick - Skilehrer Max muss seinen Spaß gehabt haben <img src='http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> :</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" title="skikurs-002" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/skikurs-002.jpg" alt="skikurs-002" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Nachdem auch noch Faschingsdienstag war, haben es sich meine Mädel auch nicht nehmen lassen verkleidet zu fahren (so wie wir das auch immer gemacht haben). Dafür gab&#8217;s dann sogar die Lift-Tageskarte umsonst:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-248" title="skikurs-003" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/skikurs-003.jpg" alt="skikurs-003" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Und zur Belohnung ging&#8217;s dann heute zum Ferienabschluss bei Kaiserwetter mit Freunden auf den Jenner. Nächstes Jahr wird es wohl eine Jahreskarte geben müssen.;-)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations! Tomorrow, the KiWi project is turning one year! Time to look back and see what we have achieved, and I dare say it is quite much, partly more than we expected: we have finalised the first Open Source (pre)release of the KiWi core system, we have learned a lot about the properties and challenges shared by all semantic social software in the areas of semantic tagging, reasoning and information extraction, we have developed a much clearer vision in the use cases, and we have been quite good in presence on conferences and other dissemination activities. Read on to learn more &#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-227"></span></p>
<p><strong>KiWi Core System</strong>. A major milestone of the first project year is the first Open Source (pre-)release of the KiWi core system. The KiWi core system is a flexible platform for building different kinds of semantic social software applications on top (currently the Semantic Wiki and the TagIT application). It provides all the core services required in such applications, like editing and tagging, the storage of content and associated meta-data, its own triple store, transactions and versioning over content and meta-data, linked open data server, and many small features semantic social software developers will like (like convenience services for working with ontologies or SKOS thesauruses, etc.). And finally: the KiWi system also has a quite neat user interface by now, rarely found in Semantic Web applications.</p>
<p>Technology-wise, the KiWi system is a component based architecture building on JBoss Seam and Java EE. The main principle is that everything is a content item, and that a content item always consists of human-readable content that is connected with RDF relations and may be annotated by users with semantic tags. This mixture allows content to be shared between applications: a content item that is created in the Wiki application can at the same time be displayed in TagIT as a location on the map or (later) as a blog post in the Blog application. This is made possible by the flexible structures offered by RDF. A particularly salient aspect of the KiWi core system is that it makes using RDF much more convenient for Java developers (no more manual triple store queries) by offering a flexible facading through interfaces annotated with special Java annotations that map Java methods to RDF properties.</p>
<p>The KiWi core system is of course not finished yet: we are planning to extend it with so-called &#8220;knowledge spaces&#8221; (separating content into different logical units), permission management is also still open, we&#8217;ll include social networking capabilities, we&#8217;ll integrate Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/peterreiser/category/Community+Equity">Community Equity</a>, and we&#8217;ll build additional applications on top of KiWi, including the personal &#8220;Dashboard&#8221;, a &#8220;Blog&#8221;, and a mobile application to access some of the functionality even when away from the computer. And then we are of course looking forward to the integration of the enabling technologies in the system!</p>
<p>Of course, a KiWi that is only one year old is still to young to really fly, and it will even still stumble from time to time, so expect bugs. But nonetheless, we are now inviting all of you, particularly (Open Source) developers and early adopters to try out and work on the KiWi system, build your own applications on top of it, or just experiment and give us feedback. You can download the latest KiWi release at the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi/downloads">Kenai Download Site</a> or just visit the <a href="http://showcase.kiwi-project.eu/KiWi/">Showcase</a> (updated regularly, may crash from time to time).</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Technologies</strong>. Working the &#8220;Wiki Way&#8221; provides a lot of challenges to research disciplines that are traditionally based on very formal means of knowledge representation, like KiWis &#8220;enabling technologies&#8221; in the areas of reasoning, information extraction, and personalisation. Established approaches - e.g. for reasoning - make assumptions about the data like consistency or pre-defined knowledge models that are not acceptable in wiki environments. Usability is also a major issue - one can hardly expect users to search in KiWi using SPARQL or similar languages.</p>
<p>Enabling Technologies in KiWi have therefore shifted from classical knowledge representation (like in RDF) to working with more Web 2.oish means like tagging. Tagging in KiWi is of course semantic: a content item can be tagged with another content item, thus immediately embedding the tagging into a (semantic) context.</p>
<p>The components developed in the enabling technologies will all build on this semantic tagging: the group in Munich is currently developing a query and reasoning language that allows to work on content items and their taggings using so-called label-keyword queries, the group in Brno is developing tag recommendation based on latent semantic analysis which will also support disambiguation, and the group in Aalborg has been working on personalised recommendations based on the tags given to content items and the tags most commonly used by the user.</p>
<p>Of course, tags are also represented as RDF triples,  making it possible to also work on the tagging data with more traditional means (e.g. SPARQL, rule languages developed for RDF, or Linked Open Data).</p>
<p><strong>Use Cases</strong>. Work on the use cases throughout the first year has been characterised with identifying what is needed by our partners and figuring out what a research project can actually deliver. In the first six months, we identified requirements. A common requirement in both use cases is the integration with existing systems, and a major step into this direction has already been made by KiWi by providing all data as Linked Open Data. Also, the Sun use case (software knowledge management) already heavily influenced the directions the core system is going: things like semantic tagging, the new user interface, the planned social networking component and dashboard, as well as the foreseen integration of Community Equity witness this.</p>
<p>The Logica use case (project knowledge management) on the other hand demonstrates the challenges faced by semantic social software when trying to deploy it in a very formal environment like project management. We are still discussing on how the KiWi system could mix Wiki-style with form-based working, and how KiWi could connect to ERP tools like Navision.</p>
<p><strong>Dissemination</strong>. Even throughout the first year, the KiWi project managed to achieve a quite high visibility in certain communities. We have developed a very detailed dissemination plan that describes the overall dissemination strategy and the activites that we aim to take.</p>
<p>On the scientific side, KiWi co-organised several well-attended events like the <a href="http://www.semwiki.org/">SemWiki08 workshop at ESWC&#8217;08</a>, the <a href="http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/swkm2008">Social Web and Knowledge Management workshop at WWW&#8217;08</a>,  the <a href="http://i-semantics.tugraz.at/">I-Semantics conference</a>, and the <a href="http://reasoningweb.org/2008/">ReasoningWeb Summer School</a>. Also, we have been present with presentations, posters, and tutorials at ESWC&#8217;08,  SofSem&#8217;08, DLAC III, XInnovations, and many more. Also, we are co-organising the <a href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SemanticWiki">Ontolog series on Semantic Wikis</a>, which established the Semantic Wiki topic as one of the mainstram topics in the Semantic Web community.</p>
<p>On the professional side, we have given early demonstrations to industry users (e.g. at the IFRA Conference on the Future of News Publishing), managed to build several additional projects on top of the KiWi platform (TagIT is a result of one of them), and there are still more to come. Also, we are receiving requests about KiWi on a weekly basis even though no software has been available until today.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we have a quite neat project identity with a nice and informative <a href="http://www.kiwi-project.eu">website</a>, public relations material, the <a href="http://planet.kiwi-project.eu">Planet KiWi blog</a>, and the <a href="http://wiki.kiwi-project.eu/?title=kiwi:Software">KiWi development community platform</a> and many small goodies that make the project visible.</p>
<p>So again: Happy Birthday KiWi! We are looking forward to your next year! And thanks to all of you for making it a success!</p>

<p>KiWi can be downloaded in the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a binary package that comes pre-configured with JBoss 4.2.3, the H2 database, and KiWi (the &#8220;one-click-install&#8221;). Unpack it and run bin/run.sh (or bin\run.bat) to start it, then go to http://localhost:8080/KiWi/, and start editing (or select &#8220;Admin&#8221; and pre-load ontologies); the binary package requires JDK 6 installed and can be downloaded from <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi/downloads">http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi/downloads</a></li>
<li>a source package that can be used for looking into the KiWi source code and compiling yourself; it requires JDK6, plus JBoss 4.2.3 and a database supported by Hibernate (PostgreSQL, H2, &#8230;), and you will need some knowledge on how to configure Java EE applications; the source package can also be downloaded from  <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi/downloads">http://kenai.com/projects/kiwi/downloads</a></li>
<li>the most recent source code can always be obtained from the Subversion repository at <a href="https://svn.salzburgresearch.at/svn/kiwi/kWi/trunk">https://svn.salzburgresearch.at/svn/kiwi/kWi/trunk</a> ; if you plan to participate in the development of KiWi, this is your option - and don&#8217;t forget to tell us, if you have good ideas and contributions, we might want to add you as committer; obviously, this option has the same requirements as the packaged source package</li>
<li>you can furthermore visit the <a href="http://showcase.kiwi-project.eu/KiWi/">Showcase</a> (updated regularly, may crash from time to time) if you only want to have a quick look into how KiWi works and looks like</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, a KiWi that is only one year old is still to young to really fly, and it will even still stumble from time to time, so expect bugs (and many of them!). But nonetheless, we are now inviting all of you, particularly (Open Source) developers and early adopters to try out and work on the KiWi system, build your own applications on top of it, or just experiment and give us feedback. If you think our ideas are interesting and you&#8217;d like to contribute, please let us know by sending a mail to info@kiwi-project.eu.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Open Source (Pre-)Release</strong>. This week has again been a busy week, as we are proceeding towards the first Open Source pre-release of the KiWi system, which we plan to upload next week or in the first week of March. Most of what we have been doing has been related to fixing bugs and improving the overall system stability. There are still some issues left, but I am confident that we can resolve them until end of next week. The KiWi distribution will be packaged both, as source and as a binary bundle that is &#8220;ready-to-start&#8221;, including JBoss Server and the H2 database, and we will host the packages either at <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>, or at the new <a href="http://www.kenai.com">Kenai</a> platform provided by our partner Sun Microsystems. The Open Source release is at the same time milestone 2 of the KiWi project (first prototype release), scheduled for month 12.</p>
<p><strong>KiWi Showcase</strong>. Today, we have also updated the KiWi Showcase Server at <a href="http://showcase.kiwi-project.eu/KiWi">http://showcase.kiwi-project.eu/KiWi</a>, where you can try out the live KiWi system with the latest layout changes and other improvements. Currently functional are only the Wiki, the TagIT application and the Inspector. The Admin currently only allows uploading ontologies, and the Logica application is non-functional (and will not be included in the Open Source release). Please let us know your impressions, either by adding comments to this post or by submitting bug reports to the <a href="http://wiki.kiwi-project.eu/atlassian-jira">Jira Issue Tracking</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning and Querying</strong>. The Munich group works on the usage model, focuses on structured tagging, negative tagging, links, relation of content items and fragments, &#8230; and summarizes its ideas as a position paper for the ESWC wiki workshop. Meanwhile further develops ideas about reasoning and querying for which the usage model serves as a common ground.</p>
<p><strong>SemWiki2009 Preparations</strong>. Next week is also the deadline for the submission of papers to the <a href="http://www.semwiki.org/">SemWiki 2009</a> workshop. We expect to submit several KiWi articles on the topics of structured tagging (see above), transactions and synchronisation, and content versatility. I&#8217;d like to use the opportunity to invite you again to submit your paper as well! The workshop was a huge success in the last years, and we expect this to be the same this year.</p>
<p><strong>KiWi Programming Camps</strong>. As the KiWi core system is stabilizing more and more, we begin thinking about organising the first (internal) &#8220;programming camps&#8221;. The idea behind the programming camps is that the KiWi development team meets for one week of &#8220;extreme programming&#8221;, where we learn from each other and try to accomplish some of the open tasks. The first programming camp is scheduled now for the 3rd week of March in Salzburg. The topics we are going to address are still under discussion, but roughly we&#8217;ll see improvements of the editor, first versions of the recommendation system, beginnings of the rule-based reasoner, an improved search functionality using label-keyword searches, some integration of the use cases, and probably more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Es gibt Situationen da ärgert man sich dass man die Kamera zu Hause gelassen hat, und so eine war heute. Eigentlich wollte ich mich nach dem Skifahren mit den Kindern am <a href="http://www.jennerbahn.de">Jenner</a> nur noch kurz etwas &#8220;auspowern&#8221; und bin gegen 16:15 nochmal von zu Hause los Richtung <a href="http://www.hochschwarzeck.info/">Hochschwarzeck</a>, von wo ich um etwa 16:30 mit meinen Ski losmarschiert bin auf das Hirscheck. Das Hirscheck ist zwar eigentlich &#8220;nichts besonderes&#8221; (360hm), aber auf jeden Fall einer der schönsten Aussichtsberge des Berchtesgadener Landes, weil es mit seinen etwa 1400m mitten im Berchtesgadener Talkessel umgeben von den 2oo0ern und fast-3000ern liegt mit einer fantastischen Sicht. Für mich war allerdings der Hauptgrund dass der Hang mit seiner Süd-West-Lage noch die letzten Sonnenstrahlen des Tages abbekommt. Eigentlich hätte ich da ja mit einem fantastischen Sonnenuntergang rechnen können, aber dass ich auch noch zum perfekten Zeitpunkt um etwa 17:00 am Gipfel stehe, wer hätte das gedacht. So mußte ich die folgenden Fotos mit meinem Handy machen - einen Eindruck kriegt man zwar, aber als Hintergrundbild taugt&#8217;s leider nichts:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" title="sonnenuntergang_reiteralm" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/sonnenuntergang_reiteralm.jpg" alt="sonnenuntergang_reiteralm" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Sonnenuntergang über dem Hochplateau der Reiter Alm, direkt zwischen dem Wagendrischlhorn und der markanten Spitze des Häuslhorns (mit etwas mehr als 2400m der höchste Punkt des Hochplateaus).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212" title="sonnenuntergang_wimbachgriess" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/sonnenuntergang_wimbachgriess.jpg" alt="sonnenuntergang_wimbachgriess" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>Das Wimbachgries, links der Watzmann und rechts der Hochkalter, die beiden höchsten Erhebungen des Berchtesgadener Landes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>KiWi&#8217;s New Clothes</strong>. As you might be aware of, we had a KiWi user interface meeting two weeks ago where Josef Holy (Sun), Werner Moser (SRFG) and I were working together on redesigning the KiWi user interface and user interaction. The result has been a set of storyboard sketches that showed various screens of the upcoming KiWi system.</p>
<p>Now, two weeks later, we have been able to realise the new layout and some of the storyboards in the live KiWi system. The KiWi has new clothes, and they look really cool (thanks for the design, Werner)! Here are two screenshots of my development system; I will try to setup a new showcase system as soon as possible:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201" title="kiwi1" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kiwi1.png" alt="kiwi1" width="600" height="359" /></p>
<p>The new wiki page presentation. In the header, you have access to the KiWi applications that are registered using the new extension mechanism (currently: Wiki, TagIT, Admin, Inspector). The black toolbar gives quick access to last visited pages (&#8221;breadcrumps&#8221;) and to login/logout functionality. Search has also been placed in the header.</p>
<p>As you can see, the old Mediawiki-style tabbed navigation between action panels has been removed in favour of a &#8220;action menu&#8221;, because 95% of wiki users are readers and do not edit. The right-hand widgets have been visually integrated as part of the page, because they display context information while the left column displays navigation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202" title="kiwi2" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kiwi2.png" alt="kiwi2" width="600" height="359" /></p>
<p>The KiWi administration interface (currently still under heavy development). It uses a layout similar to the wiki page presentation, but the main area consists of only a single column.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" title="kiwi3" src="http://www.schaffert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/kiwi3.png" alt="kiwi3" width="600" height="403" /></p>
<p>TagIT in the new KiWi layout. As you can see, TagIT fits very nicely with the new design and looks quite professional.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Open Data</strong>. Also in the news: KiWi can now act as a <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Open Data</a> server. This means that all wiki pages (content items) that KiWi creates itself have RDF URIs that resolve to the hosting KiWi system. When accessing such a URI with a linked data browser, the KiWi system returns the RDF fragment that is relevant for the content item.</p>
<p><strong>Extension Mechanism</strong>. The last major improvement this week is the realisation of the KiWi extension mechanism, which allows to modularise the system into more independent components. KiWi currently distinguishes between four different kinds of extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Applications</em> (like the Wiki or TagIT) are separate applications building on top of the KiWi core system and come with their own set of components, services, JSF files, and page flow definitions (Seam pages.xml).</li>
<li><em>Services</em> are bundles of service components that provide certain functionalities to the rest of the system. Typical services might be an &#8220;ontology service&#8221; that provides more high-level methods for modifying various kinds of ontologies in the system or a &#8220;recommendation service&#8221; that allows to compute recommendations based on the currently active context (current page, current user, current application)</li>
<li><em>Actions</em> are small extensions that add a certain action to content items like &#8220;Geolocate&#8221; or &#8220;PDF&#8221;. Actions are meant to hook into the action menu described in the user interface above (not yet implemented).</li>
<li><em>Widgets </em>are small user interface components that the user can insert into his dashboard. Examples might be &#8220;My Recommendations&#8221; or &#8220;My Tags&#8221; or similar (not yet implemented).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, KiWi is now progressing nicely. Further interesting developments are the revision service that now moves from the experimental phase into the testing phase, the improvements in the server-side clustering of geotags in the TagIT application, and some advancements in the administration.</p>
