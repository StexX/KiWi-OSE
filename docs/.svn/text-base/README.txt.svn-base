(note: on windows machines you need "\\" as directory separator in the path.)
- Directories and files with the naming pattern *.tmpl are generally predefined configurations 
that need to be copied to * (w/o .tmpl) and in some cases modified for the system work properly.

resources/KiWi-[dev|prod|test]-ds.xml, 
resources/META-INF/persistence[dev|prod|test].xml files.
