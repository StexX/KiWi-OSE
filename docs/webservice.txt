WebService interface is defined in the class kiwi.api.webservice.DataAccessService 
and implemented in kiwi.webservice.DataAccessServiceImpl - by now it provides 
three different methods for data import:
   public boolean insertData(String source, StructuredData[] data);
   public boolean insertDataCollection(String source, DataCollection dc);
   public boolean insertDataRepresentation(String source, DataRepresentation dr);

If you look into the data objects you can see that StructuredData is a simple 
name-value combination. This is encapsuled with further table information and 
references to other data sets in DataCollection, which is also the object that is 
used internally. The third method takes a DataRepresentation object wich is a 
more relational view of a data set. As DataCollection could include circular 
references, which is not acceptable for SOAP, this view is preferred for generated 
data transmission without further computing.

Internally all three methods transform the data to a DataCollection and use the 
kiwi.webservice.utilityDataInserterServiceImpl for insertion tasks. This Service 
creates an XHTML representation of the provided information and creates a 
ContentItem out of it. This content is tagged with the name of the main table and 
with the tag “Imported Data”. Each data value is also created as a fragment with 
its name. The author of all the creations mentioned above is the Import User.

The import methods return true, when the import worked, or false otherwise. 
Internally an DataImportException is thrown with a short explaination. This will 
not be sent to the client, but to the server’s logs.

For further explainations please refer to the code, as the JavaDocs are set.
