This directory contains stored procedures for the Hyperdrivre (h2) database.
Even if the file extension sugest SQL the files does not cotnains any SQL
statement, the files contains java code (methods). The H2 dababase compiles
and laod them when the database starts.
I preffer to keep the SQL extension to maintain the symilarity with the other
stored procedures.
