 * A savelet is a kind of functor that can be applied to Content objects before saving.
 * Examples are parsing all wiki-style links, automatic information extraction, etc.
 * 
 * All savelets should be implemented as stateless EJBs.

 * TODO: what is missing is some means of interacting with the user currently storing some content
 *       interaction could mean asking the user for disambiguation and similar things, maybe we could
 *       use exceptions for that?
